   Constrained Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI)
                draft-ietf-anima-constrained-voucher-19

Abstract

   This document defines the Constrained Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
   Infrastructure (Constrained BRSKI) protocol, which provides a
   solution for secure zero-touch bootstrapping of resource-constrained
   (IoT) devices into the network of a domain owner.  This protocol is
   designed for constrained networks, which may have limited data
   throughput or may experience frequent packet loss.  Constrained BRSKI
   is a variant of the BRSKI protocol, which uses an artifact signed by
   the device manufacturer called the "voucher" which enables a new
   device and the owner's network to mutually authenticate.  While the
   BRSKI voucher is typically encoded in JSON, Constrained BRSKI defines
   a compact CBOR-encoded voucher.  The BRSKI voucher is extended with
   new data types that allow for smaller voucher sizes.  The Enrollment
   over Secure Transport (EST) protocol, used in BRSKI, is replaced with
   EST-over-CoAPS; and HTTPS used in BRSKI is replaced with CoAPS.

1.  Introduction

   Secure enrollment of new nodes into constrained networks with
   constrained nodes presents unique challenges.  As explained in
   [RFC7228], the networks are challenged and the nodes are constrained
   by energy, memory space, and code size.

   The Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol
   described in [RFC8995] provides a solution for secure zero-touch
   (automated) bootstrap of new (unconfigured) devices.  In it, new
   devices, such as IoT devices, are called "pledges", and equipped with
   a factory-installed Initial Device Identifier (IDevID) (see
   [ieee802-1AR]), are enrolled into a network.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   The BRSKI solution described in [RFC8995] was designed to be modular,
   and this document describes a version scaled to the constraints of
   IoT deployments.

   Therefore, this document defines a constrained version of the voucher
   artifact (described in [RFC8366]), along with a constrained version
   of BRSKI.  This constrained-BRSKI protocol makes use of the
   constrained CoAP-based version of EST (EST-coaps from [RFC9148])
   rather than the EST over HTTPS [RFC7030].  Constrained-BRSKI is
   itself scalable to multiple resource levels through the definition of
   optional functions.  Appendix E illustrates this.

   In BRSKI, the [RFC8366] voucher is by default serialized to JSON with
   a signature in CMS [RFC5652].  This document defines a new voucher
   serialization to CBOR [RFC8949] with a signature in COSE [RFC9052].

   This COSE-signed CBOR-encoded voucher is transported using both
   secured CoAP and HTTPS.  The CoAP connection (between Pledge and
   Registrar) is to be protected by either OSCORE+EDHOC
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] or DTLS (CoAPS).  The HTTP connection (between
   Registrar and MASA) is to be protected using TLS (HTTPS).

   This document specifies a constrained voucher-request artifact based
   on Section 3 of [RFC8995], and voucher(-request) transport over CoAP
   based on Section 3 of [RFC8995] and on [RFC9148].

   The CBOR definitions for the constrained voucher format are defined
   using the mechanism described in [RFC9254] using the SID mechanism
   explained in [I-D.ietf-core-sid].  As the tooling to convert YANG
   documents into a list of SID keys is still in its infancy, the table
   of SID values presented here MUST be considered normative rather than
   the output of the tool specified in [I-D.ietf-core-sid].

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8366], and are used
   identically as in that document: artifact, domain, imprint, Join
   Registrar/Coordinator (JRC), Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA), Pledge, Registrar, Trust of First Use (TOFU), and
   Voucher.

   The following terms from [RFC8995] are used identically as in that
   document: Domain CA, enrollment, IDevID, Join Proxy, LDevID,
   manufacturer, nonced, nonceless, PKIX.

   The term Pledge Voucher Request, or acronym PVR, is introduced to
   refer to the voucher request between the pledge and the Registrar.

   The term Registrar Voucher Request, or acronym RVR, is introduced to
   refer to the voucher request between the Registrar and the MASA.

   This document uses the term "PKIX Certificate" to refer to the
   X.509v3 profile described in [RFC5280].

   In code examples, the string "<CODE BEGINS>" denotes the start of a
   code example and "<CODE ENDS>" the end of the code example.  Four
   dots ("....") in a CBOR diagnostic notation byte string denotes a
   further sequence of bytes that is not shown for brevity.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Overview of Protocol

   [RFC8366] provides for vouchers that assert proximity, authenticate
   the Registrar, and can offer varying levels of anti-replay
   protection.

   The proximity proof provided for in [RFC8366], is an assertion that
   the Pledge and the Registrar are believed to be close together, from
   a network topology point of view.  Like in [RFC8995], proximity is
   shown by making TLS connections between the Pledge and Registrar
   using IPv6 Link-Local addresses.

   The TLS connection is used to make a Voucher Request.  This request
   is verified by an agent of the Pledge's manufacturer, which then
   issues a voucher.  The voucher provides an authorization statement
   from the manufacturer indicating that the Registrar is the intended
   owner of the device.  The voucher refers to the Registrar through
   pinning of the Registrar's identity.

   This document does not make any extensions to the semantic meaning of
   vouchers, only the encoding has been changed to optimize for
   constrained devices and networks.  The two main parts of the BRSKI
   protocol are named separately in this document: BRSKI-EST for the
   protocol between Pledge and Registrar, and BRSKI-MASA for the
   protocol between the Registrar and the MASA.

   Time-based vouchers are supported in this definition, but given that
   constrained devices are extremely unlikely to have accurate time,
   their use will be uncommon.  Most Pledges using constrained vouchers
   will be online during enrollment and will use live nonces to provide
   anti-replay protection rather than expiry times.

   [RFC8366] defines the voucher artifact, while the Voucher Request
   artifact was defined in [RFC8995].  This document defines both a
   constrained voucher and a constrained voucher-request.  They are
   presented in the order "voucher-request", followed by a "voucher"
   response as this is the order that they occur in the protocol.

   The constrained voucher request MUST be signed by the Pledge.  It
   signs using the private key associated with its IDevID certificate,
   or if an IDevID is not available, then the private key associated
   with its manufacturer-installed raw public key (RPK).  Section 13
   provides additional details on PKIX-less operations.

   The constrained voucher MUST be signed by the MASA.

   For the constrained voucher request this document defines two
   distinct methods for the Pledge to identify the Registrar: using
   either the Registrar's PKIX certificate, or using a raw public key
   (RPK) of the Registrar.

   For the constrained voucher both methods are supported to indicate
   (pin) a trusted domain identity: using either a pinned domain PKIX
   certificate, or a pinned raw public key (RPK).

   The BRSKI architectures mandates that the MASA be aware of the
   capabilities of the pledge.  This is not a drawback as the pledges
   are constructed by a manufacturer which also arranges for the MASA to
   be aware of the inventory of devices.

   The MASA therefore knows if the pledge supports PKIX operations, PKIX
   format certificates, or if the pledge is limited to Raw Public Keys
   (RPK).  Based upon this, the MASA can select which attributes to use
   in the voucher for certain operations, like the pinning of the
   Registrar identity.  This is described in more detail in
   Section 9.2.3, Section 8 and Section 8.3 (for RPK specifically).

5.  Updates to RFC8366 and RFC8995

   This section details the ways in which this document updates other
   RFCs.  The terminology for Updates is taken from
   [I-D.kuehlewind-update-tag].

   *  clarifies when new trust anchors should be retrieved
      (Section 6.6.1),

   *  clarified what kinds of Extended Key Usage attributes are
      appropriate for each certificate (Section 7.3.1)

   It Extends [RFC8995] as follows:

   *  defines the CoAP version of the BRSKI protocol

   *  makes some messages optional if the results can be inferred from
      other validations (Section 6.6),

   *  provides the option to return trust anchors in a simpler format
      (Section 6.6.3)

   *  extends the BRSKI-MASA protocol to carry the new voucher-cose+cbor
      format.

6.  BRSKI-EST Protocol

   This section describes the constrained BRSKI extensions to EST-coaps
   [RFC9148] to transport the voucher between Registrar and Pledge
   (optionally via a Join Proxy) over CoAP.  The extensions are
   targeting low-resource networks with small packets.

   The constrained BRSKI-EST protocol described in this section is
   between the Pledge and the Registrar only.

6.1.  Registrar and the Server Name Indicator (SNI)

   A DTLS connection is established between the Pledge and the
   Registrar, similar to the TLS connection described in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC8995].  This may occur via a Join Proxy as described in
   Section 6.4.  Regardless of the Join Proxy mechanism, the DTLS
   connection should operate identically.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   The SNI issue described below affects [RFC8995] as well, and is
   reported in errata: https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6648

   As the Registrar is discovered by IP address, and typically connected
   via a Join Proxy, the name of the Registrar is not known to the
   Pledge.  The Pledge will not know what the hostname for the Registrar
   is, so it cannot do RFC6125 DNS-ID validation on the Registrar's
   certificate.  Instead, it must do validation using the RFC8366
   voucher.

   As the Pledge does not know the name of the Registrar, the Pledge
   cannot put any reasonable value into the [RFC6066] Server Name
   Indicator (SNI).  Threfore the Pledge SHOULD omit the SNI extension
   as per Section 9.2 of [RFC8446].

   In some cases, particularly while testing BRSKI, a Pledge may be
   given the hostname of a particular Registrar to connect to directly.
   Such a bypass of the discovery process may result in the Pledge
   taking a different code branch to establish a DTLS connection, and
   may result in the SNI being inserted by a library.  The Registrar
   MUST ignore any SNI seen.

   A primary motivation for making the SNI ubiquitous in the public web
   is because it allows for multi-tenant hosting of HTTPS sites on a
   single (scarce) IPv4 address.  This consideration does not apply to
   the server function in the Registrar because:

   *  it uses DTLS and CoAP, not HTTPS

   *  it typically uses IPv6, often [RFC4193] Unique Local Address,
      which are plentiful

   *  the server port number is typically discovered, so multiple
      tenants can be accomodated via unique port numbers.

   As per Section 3.6.1 of [RFC7030], the Registrar certificate MUST
   have the Extended Key Usage (EKU) id-kp-cmcRA.  This certificate is
   also used as a TLS Server Certificate, so it MUST also have the EKU
   id-kp-serverAuth.

6.2.  TLS Client Certificates: IDevID authentication

   As described in Section 5.1 of [RFC8995], the Pledge makes a
   connection to the Registrar using a TLS Client Certificate for
   authentication.

   Subsequently the Pledge will send a Pledge Voucher Request (PVR).

   In Section 8.1, the contents of the "x5bag" structure in the
   Registrar Voucher Request (RVR) are explained.  In Section 9.3 the
   use of the "x5bag" structure and the "kid" attribute in the PVR and
   the RVR are specified.

6.3.  Resource Discovery, URIs and Content Formats

   To keep the protocol messages small the EST-coaps and constrained-
   BRSKI URIs are shorter than the respective EST and BRSKI URIs.

   The EST-coaps server URIs differ from the EST URIs by replacing the
   scheme https by coaps and by specifying shorter resource path names.
   Below are some examples; the first two using a discovered short path
   name and the last one using the well-known URI of EST which requires
   no discovery.

     coaps://server.example.com/est/<short-name>
     coaps://server.example.com/e/<short-name>
     coaps://server.example.com/.well-known/est/<short-name>

   Similarly the constrained BRSKI server URIs differ from the BRSKI
   URIs by replacing the scheme https by coaps and by specifying shorter
   resource path names.  Below are some examples; the first two using a
   discovered short path name and the last one using the well-known URI
   prefix which requires no discovery.  This is the same "/.well-known/
   brski" prefix as defined in Section 5 of [RFC8995].

     coaps://server.example.com/brski/<short-name>
     coaps://server.example.com/b/<short-name>
     coaps://server.example.com/.well-known/brski/<short-name>

   Figure 5 in Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7030] enumerates the operations
   supported by EST, for which Table 1 in Section 5.1 of [RFC9148]
   enumerates the corresponding EST-coaps short path names.  Similarly,
   Table 1 below provides the mapping from the supported BRSKI extension
   URI paths to the constrained-BRSKI URI paths.

                   Table 1: BRSKI URI paths mapping to
                       Constrained BRSKI URI paths

   Note that /requestvoucher indicated above occurs between the Pledge
   and Registrar (in scope of the BRSKI-EST protocol), but it also
   occurs between Registrar and MASA.  However, as described in
   Section 6, this section and above table addresses only the BRSKI-EST
   protocol.

   Pledges that wish to discover the available BRSKI bootstrap options/
   formats, or reduce the size of the CoAP headers by eliminating the
   "/.well-known/brski" path, can do a discovery operation using
   [RFC6690] Section 4 by sending a discovery query to the Registrar.

   For example, if the Registrar supports a short BRSKI URL (/b) and
   supports the voucher format "application/voucher-cose+cbor" (836),
   and status reporting in both CBOR and JSON formats:

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core?rt=brski*

     RES: 2.05 Content
     Content-Format: 40
     Payload:
     </b>;rt=brski,
     </b/rv>;rt=brski.rv;ct=836,
     </b/vs>;rt=brski.vs;ct="50 60",
     </b/es>;rt=brski.es;ct="50 60"

   The Registrar is under no obligation to provide shorter URLs, and MAY
   respond to this query with only the "/.well-known/brski/<short-name>"
   resources for the short names as defined in Table 1.

   Registrars that have implemented shorter URLs MUST also respond in
   equivalent ways to the corresponding "/.well-known/brski/<short-
   name>" URLs, and MUST NOT distinguish between them.  In particular, a
   Pledge MAY use the longer and shorter URLs in any combination.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   When responding to a discovery request for BRSKI resources, the
   server MAY in addition return the full resource paths and the content
   types which are supported by these resources as shown in above
   example.  This is useful when multiple content types are specified
   for a particular resource on the server.  The server responds with
   only the root path for the BRSKI resources (rt=brski, resource /b in
   above example) and no others in case the client queries for only
   rt=brski type resources.  (So, a query for rt=brski, without the
   wildcard character.)

   Without discovery, a longer well-known URL can only be used, such as:

      REQ: GET /.well-known/brski/rv

   while with discovery of shorter URLs, a request such as:

      REQ: GET /b/rv

   is possible.

   The return of multiple content-types in the "ct" attribute allows the
   Pledge to choose the most appropriate one.  Note that Content-Format
   836 ("application/voucher-cose+cbor") is defined in this document.

   Content-Format 836 MUST be supported by the Registrar for the /rv
   resource.  If the "ct" attribute is not indicated for the /rv
   resource in the link format description, this implies that at least
   836 is supported.

   Note that this specification allows for voucher-cose+cbor format
   requests and vouchers to be transmitted over HTTPS, as well as for
   voucher-cms+json and other formats yet to be defined over CoAP.  The
   burden for this flexibility is placed upon the Registrar.  A Pledge
   on constrained hardware is expected to support a single format only.

   The Pledge and MASA need to support one or more formats (at least
   836) for the voucher and for the voucher request.  The MASA needs to
   support all formats that the Pledge supports.

   Section 11 details how the Pledge discovers the Registrar and Join
   Proxy in different deployment scenarios.

6.3.1.  RFC8995 Telemetry Returns

   [RFC8995] defines two telemetry returns from the Pledge which are
   sent to the Registrar.  These are the BRSKI Status Telemetry
   [RFC8995], Section 5.7 and the Enrollment Status Telemetry [RFC8995],
   Section 5.9.4.  These are two POST operations made the by Pledge at
   two key steps in the process.

   [RFC8995] defines the content of these POST operations in CDDL, which
   are serialized as JSON.  This document extends the list of acceptable
   formats to CBOR as well as JSON, using the rules from [RFC8610].

   The existing JSON format is described as CoAP Content-Format 50
   ("application/json"), and it MAY be supported.  The new CBOR format
   described as CoAP Content-Format 60 ("application/cbor"), MUST be
   supported by the Registrar for both the /vs and /es resources.

6.4.  Join Proxy options

   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-join-proxy] specifies the details for a
   stateful and stateless constrained Join Proxy which is equivalent to
   [RFC8995], Section 4.

6.5.  Extensions to BRSKI

   The following section explains extension within the BRSKI/CoAP
   connection itself.  Section 10 explains ways in which a pledge may
   discover the capability to use constrained vouchers, and to use the
   CoAPS transport.

6.5.1.  CoAP EST Resource Discovery and BRSKI

   Once the Pledge discovers an IP address and port number that connects
   to the Registrar (probably via a Join Proxy), and it establishes a
   DTLS connection.

   No further discovery of hosts or port numbers is required, but a
   pledge that can do more than one kind of enrollment (future work
   offers protocols other than [RFC9148]), then a pledge may need to use
   CoAP Discovery to determine what other protocols are available.

   A Pledge that only supports the EST-coaps enrollment method SHOULD
   NOT use CoAP discovery for BRSKI/EST resources.  It is more efficient
   to just try the supported enrollment method via the well-known BRSKI/
   EST-coaps resources.  This also avoids the Pledge having to do any
   CoRE Link Format parsing, which is specified in [RFC9148],
   Section 4.1.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   The Registrar MUST support all of the EST resources at their default
   ".well-known" locations (on the specified port) as well as any
   server-specific shorter form that might also be supported.

   However, if discovery is done by the Pledge, it is possible for the
   Registrar to return references to resources which are on different
   port numbers.  The Registrar SHOULD NOT use different ports numbers
   by default, because a Pledge that is connected via a Join Proxy can
   only access a single UDP port.

   A Pledge that receives different port numbers or names SHOULD ignore
   those port numbers and continue to use the DTLS connection that it
   has already created.  Or it MAY fail the entire transaction and look
   for another Join Proxy/Registrar to do onboarding with.  (If the
   resources without the port numbers do not work, then the Pledge will
   fail anyway)

   A Registrar configured to never use Join Proxies MAY be configured to
   use multiple port numbers.  Therefore a Registrar MUST host all
   discoverable BRSKI resources on the same (UDP) server port that the
   Pledge's DTLS connection is using.  However, using the same UDP
   server port for all resources allows the Pledge to continue via the
   same DTLS connection which is more efficient.

6.5.2.  CoAP responses

   [RFC8995], Section 5 defines a number of HTTP response codes that the
   Registrar is to return when certain conditions occur.

   The 401, 403, 404, 406 and 415 response codes map directly to CoAP
   codes 4.01, 4.03, 4.04, 4.06 and 4.15.

   The 202 Retry process which occurs in the voucher request, is to be
   handled in the same way as Section 5.7 of [RFC9148] process for
   Delayed Responses.

6.6.  Extensions to EST-coaps

   This document extends [RFC9148], and it inherits the functions
   described in that document: specifically, the mandatory Simple
   (Re-)Enrollment (/sen and /sren) and Certification Authority
   certificates request (/crts).  Support for CSR Attributes Request
   (/att) and server-side key generation (/skg, /skc) remains optional
   for the EST server.

   Collecting the resource definitions from both [RFC8995], [RFC7030],
   and [RFC9148] results in the following shorter forms of URI paths for
   the commonly used resources:

                         BRSKI/EST short URI paths

6.6.1.  Pledge Extensions

   This section defines extensions to the BRSKI Pledge, which are
   applicable during the BRSKI bootstrap procedure.  A Pledge which only
   supports the EST-coaps enrollment method, SHOULD NOT use discovery
   for EST-coaps resources, because it is more efficient to enroll (e.g.
   /sen) via the well-known EST resource on the current DTLS connection.
   This avoids an additional round-trip of packets and avoids the Pledge
   having to unnecessarily implement CoRE Link Format parsing.

   A constrained Pledge SHOULD NOT perform the optional EST "CSR
   attributes request" (/att) to minimize network traffic.  The Pledge
   selects which attributes to include in the CSR.

   One or more Subject Distinguished Name fields MUST be included.  If
   the Pledge has no specific information on what attributes/fields are
   desired in the CSR, it MUST use the Subject Distinguished Name fields
   from its IDevID unmodified.  The Pledge can receive such information
   via the voucher (encoded in a vendor-specific way) or via some other,
   out-of-band means.

   A constrained Pledge MAY use the following optimized EST-coaps
   procedure to minimize network traffic.

   1.  if the voucher, that validates the current Registrar, contains a
       single pinned domain CA certificate, the Pledge provisionally
       considers this certificate as the EST trust anchor, as if it were
       the result of "CA certificates request" (/crts) to the Registrar.

   2.  Using this CA certificate as trust anchor it proceeds with EST
       simple enrollment (/sen) to obtain its provisionally trusted
       LDevID certificate.

   3.  If the Pledge validates that the trust anchor CA was used to sign
       its LDevID certificate, the Pledge accepts the pinned domain CA
       certificate as the legitimate trust anchor CA for the Registrar's
       domain and accepts the associated LDevID certificate.

   4.  If the trust anchor CA was NOT used to sign its LDevID
       certificate, the Pledge MUST perform an actual "CA certificates
       request" (/crts) to the EST server to obtain the EST CA trust
       anchor(s) since these can differ from the (temporary) pinned
       domain CA.

   5.  When doing this /crts request, the Pledge MAY use a CoAP Accept
       Option with value 287 ("application/pkix-cert") to limit the
       number of returned EST CA trust anchors to only one.  A
       constrained Pledge MAY support only this format in a /crts
       response, per Section 5.3 of [RFC9148].

   6.  If the Pledge cannot obtain the single CA certificate or the
       finally validated CA certificate cannot be chained to the LDevID
       certificate, then the Pledge MUST abort the enrollment process
       and report the error using the enrollment status telemetry (/es).

   Note that even though the Pledge may avoid performing any /crts
   request using the above EST-coaps procedure during bootstrap, it
   SHOULD support retrieval of the trust anchor CA periodically as
   detailed in the next section.

6.6.2.  EST-client Extensions

   This section defines extensions to EST-coaps clients, used after the
   BRSKI bootstrap procedure is completed.  (Note that such client is
   not called "Pledge" in this section, since it is already enrolled
   into the domain.)  A constrained EST-coaps client MAY support only
   the Content-Format 287 ("application/pkix-cert") in a /crts response,
   per Section 5.3 of [RFC9148].  In this case, it can only store one
   trust anchor of the domain.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   An EST-coaps client that has an idea of the current time (internally,
   or via NTP) SHOULD consider the validity time of the trust anchor CA,
   and MAY begin requesting a new trust anchor CA using the /crts
   request when the CA has 50% of it's validity time (notAfter -
   notBefore) left.  A client without access to the current time cannot
   decide if the trust anchor CA has expired, and SHOULD poll
   periodically for a new trust anchor using the /crts request at an
   interval of approximately 1 month.  An EST-coaps server SHOULD
   include the CoAP ETag Option in every response to a /crts request, to
   enable clients to perform low-overhead validation whether their trust
   anchor CA is still valid.  The EST-coaps client SHOULD store the ETag
   resulting from a /crts response in memory and SHOULD use this value
   in an ETag Option in its next GET /crts request.

   The above-mentioned limitation that an EST-coaps client may support
   only one trust anchor CA is not an issue in case the domain trust
   anchor remains stable.  However, special consideration is needed for
   cases where the domain trust anchor can change over time.  Such a
   change may happen due to relocation of the client device to a new
   domain, or due to key update of the trust anchor as described in
   [RFC4210], Section 4.4.

   From the client's viewpoint, a trust anchor change typically happens
   during EST re-enrollment: a change of domain CA requires all devices
   operating under the old domain CA to acquire a new LDevID issued by
   the new domain CA.  A client's re-enrollment may be triggered by
   various events, such as an instruction to re-enroll sent by a domain
   entity, or an imminent expiry of its LDevID certificate.  How the re-
   enrollment is explicitly triggered on the client by a domain entity,
   such as a commissioner or a Registrar, is out of scope of this
   specification.

   The mechanism described in [RFC4210], Section 4.4 for Root CA key
   update requires four certificates: OldWithOld, OldWithNew,
   NewWithOld, and NewWithNew.  The OldWithOld certificate is already
   stored in the EST client's trust store.  The NewWithNew certificate
   will be distributed as the single certificate in a /crts response,
   during EST re-enrollment.  Since the EST client can only accept a
   single certificate in a /crts response it implies that the EST client
   cannot obtain the certificates OldWithNew and NewWithOld in this way,
   to perform the complete verification of the new domain CA.  Instead,
   the client only verifies the EST server (Registrar) using its old
   domain CA certificate in its trust store as detailed below, and based
   on this trust in the active and valid DTLS connection it
   automatically trusts the new (NewWithNew) domain CA certificate that
   the EST server provides in the /crts response.

   In this manner, even during rollover of trust anchors, it is possible
   to have only a single trust anchor provided in a /crts response.

   During the period of the certificate renewal, it is not possible to
   create new communication channels between devices with NewCA
   certificates devices with OldCA certificates.  One option is that
   devices should avoid restarting existing DTLS or OSCORE connections
   during this interval that new certificates are being deployed.  The
   recommended period for certificate renewal is 24 hours.  For re-
   enrollment, the constrained EST-coaps client MUST support the
   following EST-coaps procedure, where optional re-enrollment to a new
   domain is under control of the Registrar:

   1.  The client connects with DTLS to the Registrar, and authenticates
       with its present domain certificate (LDevID certificate) as
       usual.  The Registrar authenticates itself with its domain
       certificate that is trusted by the client, i.e. it chains to the
       single trust anchor that the client has stored.  This is the
       "old" trust anchor, the one that will be eventually replaced in
       case the Registrar decides to re-enroll the client into a new
       domain.

   2.  The client performs the simple re-enrollment request (/sren) and
       upon success it obtains a new LDevID.

   3.  The client verifies the new LDevID against its (single) existing
       domain trust anchor.  If it chains successfully, this means the
       trust anchor did not change and the client MAY skip retrieving
       the current CA certificate using the "CA certificates request"
       (/crts).  If it does not chain successfully, this means the trust
       anchor was changed/updated and the client then MUST retrieve the
       new domain trust anchor using the "CA certificates request"
       (/crts).

   4.  If the client retrieved a new trust anchor in step 3, then it
       MUST verify that the new trust anchor chains with the new LDevID
       certificate it obtained in step 2.  If it chains successfully,
       the client stores both, accepts the new LDevID certificate and
       stops using it prior LDevID certificate.  If it does not chain
       successfully, the client MUST NOT update its LDevID certificate,
       it MUST NOT update its (single) domain trust anchor, and the
       client MUST abort the enrollment process and report the error to
       the Registrar using enrollment status telemetry (/es).

   Note that even though the EST-coaps client may skip the /crts request
   in step 3, it SHOULD support retrieval of the trust anchor CA
   periodically as detailed earlier in this section.

6.6.3.  Registrar Extensions

   A Registrar SHOULD host any discoverable EST-coaps resources on the
   same (UDP) server port that the Pledge's DTLS initial connection is
   using.  This avoids the overhead of the Pledge reconnecting using
   DTLS, when it performs EST enrollment after the BRSKI voucher
   request.

   The Content-Format 50 (application/json) MUST be supported and 60
   (application/cbor) MUST be supported by the Registrar for the /vs and
   /es resources.

   Content-Format 836 MUST be supported by the Registrar for the /rv
   resource.

   When a Registrar receives a "CA certificates request" (/crts) request
   with a CoAP Accept Option with value 287 ("application/pkix-cert") it
   SHOULD return only the single CA certificate that is the envisioned
   or actual authority for the current, authenticated Pledge making the
   request.

   If the Pledge included in its request an Accept Option for only the
   287 ("application/pkix-cert") Content Format, but the domain has been
   configured to operate with multiple CA trust anchors only, then the
   Registrar returns a 4.06 Not Acceptable error to signal that the
   Pledge needs to use the Content Format 281 ("application/pkcs7-mime;
   smime-type=certs-only") to retrieve all the certificates.

   If the current authenticated client is an EST-coaps client that was
   already enrolled in the domain, and the Registrar is configured to
   assign this client to a new domain CA trust anchor during the next
   EST re-enrollment procedure, then the Registrar MUST respond with the
   new domain CA certificate in case the client performs the "CA
   Certificates request" (/crts) with an Accept Option for 287 only.
   This signals the client that a new domain is assigned to it.  The
   client follows the procedure as defined in Section 6.6.2.

6.7.  DTLS handshake fragmentation Considerations

   DTLS includes a mechanism to fragment the handshake messages.  This
   is described in Section 4.4 of [RFC9147].  The protocol described in
   this document will often be used with a Join Proxy described in
   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-join-proxy].  The Join Proxy will need
   some overhead, while the maximum packet sized guaranteed on 802.15.4
   networks is 1280 bytes.  It is RECOMMENDED that a PMTU of 1024 bytes
   be assumed for the DTLS handshake.  It is unlikely that any Packet
   Too Big indications [RFC4443] will be relayed by the Join Proxy.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   During the operation of the constrained BRSKI-EST protocol, the CoAP
   Blockwise transfer mechanism will be used when message sizes exceed
   the PMTU.  A Pledge/EST-client on a constrained network MUST use the
   (D)TLS maximum fragment length extension ("max_fragment_length")
   defined in Section 4 of [RFC6066] with the maximum fragment length
   set to a value of either 2^9 or 2^10.

7.  BRSKI-MASA Protocol

   This section describes extensions to and clarifications of the BRSKI-
   MASA protocol between Registrar and MASA.

7.1.  Protocol and Formats

   Section 5.4 of [RFC8995] describes a connection between the Registrar
   and the MASA as being a normal TLS connection using HTTPS.  This
   document does not change that.  The Registrar MUST use the format
   "application/voucher-cose+cbor" in its voucher request to MASA, when
   the Pledge uses this format in its request to the Registrar
   [RFC8995].

   The MASA only needs to support formats for which it has constructed
   Pledges that use that format.

   The Registrar MUST use the same format for the RVR as the Pledge used
   for its PVR.

   The Registrar indicates the voucher format it wants to receive from
   MASA using the HTTP Accept header.  This format MUST be the same as
   the format of the PVR, so that the Pledge can parse it.

   At the moment of writing the creation of coaps based MASAs is deemed
   unrealistic.  The use of CoAP for the BRSKI-MASA connection can be
   the subject of another document.  Some consideration was made to
   specify CoAP support for consistency, but:

   *  the Registrar is not expected to be so constrained that it cannot
      support HTTPS client connections.

   *  the technology and experience to build Internet-scale HTTPS
      responders (which the MASA is) is common, while the experience
      doing the same for CoAP is much less common.

   *  a Registrar is likely to provide onboarding services to both
      constrained and non-constrained devices.  Such a Registrar would
      need to speak HTTPS anyway.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   *  a manufacturer is likely to offer both constrained and non-
      constrained devices, so there may in practice be no situation in
      which the MASA could be CoAP-only.  Additionally, as the MASA is
      intended to be a function that can easily be oursourced to a
      third-party service provider, reducing the complexity would also
      seem to reduce the cost of that function.

   *  security-related considerations: see Section 15.6.

7.2.  Registrar Voucher Request

   If the PVR contains a proximity assertion, the Registrar MUST
   propagate this assertion into the RVR by including the "assertion"
   field with the value "proximity".  This conforms to the example in
   Section 3.3 of [RFC8995] of carrying the assertion forward.

7.3.  MASA and the Server Name Indicator (SNI)

   A TLS/HTTPS connection is established between the Registrar and MASA.

   Section 5.4 of [RFC8995] explains this process, and there are no
   externally visible changes.  A MASA that supports the unconstrained
   voucher formats should be able to support constrained voucher formats
   equally well.

   There is no requirement that a single MASA be used for both
   constrained and unconstrained voucher requests: the choice of MASA is
   determined by the id-mod-MASAURLExtn2016 extension contained in the
   IDevID.

   The Registrar MUST do [RFC6125] DNS-ID checks on the contents of the
   certificate provided by the MASA.

   In constrast to the Pledge/Registrar situation, the Registrar always
   knows the name of the MASA, and MUST always include an [RFC6066]
   Server Name Indicator.  The SNI is optional in TLS1.2, but common.
   The SNI it considered mandatory with TLS1.3.

   The presence of the SNI is needed by the MASA, in order for the
   MASA's server to host multiple tenants (for different customers).

   The Registrar SHOULD use a TLS Client Certificate to authenticate to
   the MASA per Section 5.4.1 of [RFC8995].  If the certificate that the
   Registrar uses is marked as a id-kp-cmcRA certificate, via Extended
   Key Usage, then it MUST also have the id-kp-clientAuth EKU attribute
   set.

7.3.1.  Registrar Certificate Requirement

   In summary for typical Registrar use, where a single Registrar
   certificate is used, then the certificate MUST have EKU of: id-kp-
   cmcRA, id-kp-serverAuth, id-kp-clientAuth.

8.  Pinning in Voucher Artifacts

   The voucher is a statement by the MASA for use by the Pledge that
   provides the identity of the Pledge's owner.  This section describes
   how the owner's identity is determined and how it is specified within
   the voucher.

8.1.  Registrar Identity Selection and Encoding

   Section 5.5 of [RFC8995] describes BRSKI policies for selection of
   the owner identity.  It indicates some of the flexibility that is
   possible for the Registrar, and recommends the Registrar to include
   only certificates in the voucher request (CMS) signing structure that
   participate in the certificate chain that is to be pinned.

   The MASA is expected to evaluate the certificates included by the
   Registrar in its voucher request, forming them into a chain with the
   Registrar's (signing) identity on one end.  Then, it pins a
   certificate selected from the chain.  For instance, for a domain with
   a two-level certification authority (see Figure 1), where the
   voucher-request has been signed by "Registrar", its signing structure
   includes two additional CA certificates.  The arrows in the figure
   indicate the issuing of a certificate, i.e. author of (1) issued (2)
   and author of (2) issued (3).

                         Figure 1: Two-Level CA PKI

   When the Registrar is using a COSE-signed constrained voucher request
   towards MASA, instead of a regular CMS-signed voucher request, the
   COSE_Sign1 object contains a protected and an unprotected header.
   The Registrar MUST place all the certificates needed to validate the
   signature chain from the Registrar on the RVR in an "x5bag" attribute
   in the unprotected header [I-D.ietf-cose-x509].

   The "x5bag" attribute is very important as it provides the required
   signals from the Registrar to control what identity is pinned in the
   resulting voucher.  This is explained in the next section.

8.2.  MASA Pinning Policy

   The MASA, having assembled and verified the chain in the signing
   structure of the voucher request needs to select a certificate to
   pin.  (For the case that only the Registrar's End-Entity certificate
   is included, only this certificate can be selected and this section
   does not apply.)  The BRSKI policy for pinning by the MASA as
   described in Section 5.5.2 of [RFC8995] leaves much flexibility to
   the manufacturer.

   The present document adds the following rules to the MASA pinning
   policy to reduce the network load:

   1.  for a voucher containing a nonce, it SHOULD select the most
       specific (lowest-level) CA certificate in the chain.




Richardson, et al.        Expires 10 June 2023                 [Page 23]

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   2.  for a nonceless voucher, it SHOULD select the least-specific
       (highest-level) CA certificate in the chain that is allowed under
       the MASA's policy for this specific domain.

   The rationale for 1. is that in case of a voucher with nonce, the
   voucher is valid only in scope of the present DTLS connection between
   Pledge and Registrar anyway, so there is no benefit to pin a higher-
   level CA.  By pinning the most specific CA the constrained Pledge can
   validate its DTLS connection using less crypto operations.  The
   rationale for pinning a CA instead of the Registrar's End-Entity
   certificate directly is based on the following benefit on constrained
   networks: the pinned certificate in the voucher can in common cases
   be re-used as a Domain CA trust anchor during the EST enrollment and
   during the operational phase that follows after EST enrollment, as
   explained in Section 6.6.1.

   The rationale for 2. follows from the flexible BRSKI trust model for,
   and purpose of, nonceless vouchers (Sections 5.5.* and 7.4.1 of
   [RFC8995]).

   Refering to Figure 1 of a domain with a two-level certification
   authority, the most specific CA ("Sub-CA") is the identity that is
   pinned by MASA in a nonced voucher.  A Registrar that wished to have
   only the Registrar's End-Entity certificate pinned would omit the
   "domain CA" and "Sub-CA" certificates from the voucher-request.

   In case of a nonceless voucher, depending on the trust level, the
   MASA pins the "Registrar" certificate (low trust in customer), or the
   "Sub-CA" certificate (in case of medium trust, implying that any
   Registrar of that sub-domain is acceptable), or even the "domain CA"
   certificate (in case of high trust in the customer, and possibly a
   pre-agreed need of the customer to obtain flexible long-lived
   vouchers).

8.3.  Pinning of Raw Public Keys

   Specifically for constrained use cases, the pinning of the raw public
   key (RPK) of the Registrar is also supported in the constrained
   voucher, instead of an PKIX certificate.  If an RPK is pinned it MUST
   be the RPK of the Registrar.

   When the Pledge is known by MASA to support RPK but not PKIX
   certificates, the voucher produced by the MASA pins the RPK of the
   Registrar in either the "pinned-domain-pubk" or "pinned-domain-pubk-
   sha256" field of a voucher.  This is described in more detail in
   Section 9.2.3.  A Pledge that does not support PKIX certificates
   cannot use EST to enroll; it has to use another method for enrollment
   without certificates and the Registrar has to support this method



Richardson, et al.        Expires 10 June 2023                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   also.  It is possible that the Pledge will not enroll, but instead
   only a network join operation will occur (See [RFC9031]).  How the
   Pledge discovers this method and details of the enrollment method are
   out of scope of this document.

   When the Pledge is known by MASA to support PKIX format certificates,
   the "pinned-domain-cert" field present in a voucher typically pins a
   domain certificate.  That can be either the End-Entity certificate of
   the Registrar, or the certificate of a domain CA of the Registrar's
   domain as specified in Section 8.2.  However, if the Pledge is known
   to also support RPK pinning and the MASA intends to identify the
   Registrar in the voucher (not the CA), then MASA MUST pin the RPK
   (RPK3 in Figure 2) of the Registrar instead of the Registrar's End-
   Entity certificate to save space in the voucher.

8.4.  Considerations for use of IDevID-Issuer

   [RFC8366] and [RFC8995] defines the idevid-issuer attribute for
   voucher and voucher-request (respectively), but they summarily
   explain when to use it.

   The use of idevid-issuer is provided so that the serial-number to
   which the issued voucher pertains can be relative to the entity that
   issued the devices' IDevID.  In most cases there is a one to one
   relationship between the trust anchor that signs vouchers (and is
   trusted by the pledge), and the Certification Authority that signs
   the IDevID.  In that case, the serial-number in the voucher must
   refer to the same device as the serial-number that is in IDevID
   certificate.





Richardson, et al.        Expires 10 June 2023                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   However, there situations where the one to one relationship may be
   broken.  This occurs whenever a manufacturer has a common MASA, but
   different products (on different assembly lines) are produced with
   identical serial numbers.  A system of serial numbers which is just a
   simple counter is a good example of this.  A system of serial numbers
   where there is some prefix relating the product type does not fit
   into this, even if the lower digits are a counter.

   It is not possible for the Pledge or the Registrar to know which
   situation applies.  The question to be answered is whether or not to
   include the idevid-issuer in the PVR and the RVR.  A second question
   arisews as to what the format of the idevid-issuer contents are.

   Analysis of the situation shows that the pledge never needs to
   include the idevid-issuer in it's PVR, because the pledge's IDevID
   certificate is available to the Registrar, and the Authority Key
   Identifier is contained within that.  The pledge therefore has no
   need to repeat this.

   For the RVR, the Registrar has to examine the pledge's IDevID
   certificate to discover the serial number for the Registrar's Voucher
   Request (RVR).  This is clear in Section 5.5 of [RFC8995].  That
   section also clarifies that the idevid-issuer is to be included in
   the RVR.

   Concerning the Authority Key Identifier, [RFC8366] specifies that the
   entire object i.e. the extnValue OCTET STRING is to be included:
   comprising the AuthorityKeyIdentifier, SEQUENCE, Choice as well as
   the OCTET STRING that is the keyIdentifier.

     description
      "This module defines the format for a voucher request,
       which is produced by a pledge to request a voucher.
       The voucher-request is sent to the potential owner's
       Registrar, which in turn sends the voucher request to
       the manufacturer or its delegate (MASA).

       A voucher is then returned to the pledge, binding the
       pledge to the owner.  This is a constrained version of the
       voucher-request present in
       {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrap-keyinfra}}

       This version provides a very restricted subset appropriate
       for very constrained devices.
       In particular, it assumes that nonce-ful operation is
       always required, that expiration dates are rather weak, as no
       clocks can be assumed, and that the Registrar is identified
       by either a pinned Raw Public Key of the Registrar, or by a
       pinned X.509 certificate of the Registrar or domain CA.

       The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',
       'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
       and 'OPTIONAL' in the module text are to be interpreted as
       described in RFC 2119.";

   The voucher's primary purpose is to securely assign a Pledge to an
   owner.  The voucher informs the Pledge which entity it should
   consider to be its owner.

9.3.  Signing voucher and voucher-request artifacts with COSE

   The COSE_Sign1 structure is discussed in Section 4.2 of [RFC9052].
   The CBOR object that carries the body, the signature, and the
   information about the body and signature is called the COSE_Sign1
   structure.  It is used when only one signature is used on the body.

   Support for ECDSA with SHA2-256 using curve secp256r1 (aka
   prime256k1) is RECOMMENDED.  Most current low power hardware has
   support for acceleration of this algorithm.  Future hardware designs
   could omit this in favour of a newer algorithms.  This is the ES256
   keytype from Table 1 of [RFC9053].  Support for curve secp256k1 is
   OPTIONAL.

   Support for EdDSA using Curve 25519 is RECOMMENDED in new designs if
   hardware support is available.  This is keytype EDDSA (-8) from
   Table 2 of [RFC9053].  A "crv" parameter is necessary to specify the
   Curve, which from Table 18.  The 'kty' field MUST be present, and it
   MUST be 'OKP'.  (Table 17)

   A transition towards EdDSA is occuring in the industry.  Some
   hardware can accelerate only some algorithms with specific curves,
   other hardware can accelerate any curve, and still other kinds of
   hardware provide a tool kit for acceleration of any eliptic curve
   algorithm.

   In general, the Pledge is expected to support only a single
   algorithm, while the Registrar, usually not constrained, is expected
   to support a wide variety of algorithms: both legacy ones and up-and-
   coming ones via regular software updates.

   An example of the supported COSE_Sign1 object structure is shown in
   Figure 3.

   The [COSE-registry] specifies the integers/encoding for the "alg" and
   "kid" fields in Figure 3.  The "alg" field restricts the key usage
   for verification of this COSE object to a particular cryptographic
   algorithm.

   The "kid" field is optionally present: it is an unprotected field
   that identifies the public key of the key pair that was used to sign
   this message.  The value of the key identifier "kid" parameter is an
   example value.  Usually a hash of the public key is used to identify
   the public key, but a device serial number may also be used.  The
   choice of key identifier method is vendor-specific.  If "kid" is not
   present, then a verifying party needs to use other context
   information to retrieve the right public key to verify the COSE_Sign1
   object against.  For example, this context information may be a
   unique serial number encoded in the binary content (CBOR) field.

9.3.1.  signing of Registrar Voucher Request (RVR)

   A Registrar MUST include a COSE "x5bag" structure as explained in
   Section 8.1.

   By default, a Registrar does not include a "kid" parameter in its RVR
   since the signing key is already identified by the included signing
   certificates in the COSE "x5bag" structure.

   A Registrar MAY use a "kid" parameter in its RVR to identify its
   signing key as used to sign the RVR.  The method of generating this
   "kid" is vendor-specific and SHOULD be configurable in the Registrar
   to support commonly used methods.  In order to support future
   business cases and supply chain integrations, a Registrar MUST be
   configurable, on a per-manufacturer basis, to be able to configure
   the "kid" to a particular value.  Both binary and string values are
   to be supported, each being inserted using a CBOR bstr or tstr.

9.3.2.  signing of Pledge Voucher Request (PVR)

   A Pledge SHOULD NOT use a "kid" parameter in its PVR, because its
   signing key is already identified by the Pledge's unique serial
   number that is included in the PVR.  Still, where needed the Pledge
   MAY use a "kid" parameter in its PVR to help the MASA identify the
   right public key to verify against.  This can occur for example if a
   Pledge has multiple IDevID identities.  A Registrar normally SHOULD
   ignore a "kid" parameter used in a received PVR, as this information
   is intended for the MASA.  In other words, there is no need for the
   Registrar to verify the contents of this field, but it may include it
   in an audit log.





Richardson, et al.        Expires 10 June 2023                 [Page 38]

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   The Pledge SHOULD NOT use the "x5bag" structure in the PVR.  A
   Registrar that processes a PVR with an "x5bag" structure MUST ignore
   it, and MUST use only the TLS Client Certificate extension for
   authentication of the Pledge.

   A situation where the Pledge MAY use the x5bag structure is for
   communication of certificate chains to the MASA.  This would arise in
   some vendor- specific situations involving outsourcing of MASA
   functionality, or rekeying of the IDevID certification authority.

   In Appendix C a binary COSE_Sign1 object is shown based on the
   voucher-request example of Section 9.1.4.

9.3.3.  signing of voucher by MASA

   The MASA SHOULD NOT use a "kid" parameter in the voucher response,
   because its signing key is already identified by the Pledge.  Still,
   where needed the MASA MAY use a "kid" parameter in the voucher
   response to help the Pledge identify the right public key to verify
   against.  This can occur for example if a Pledge has multiple IDevID
   identities.

   The MASA SHOULD NOT include an x5bag structure in the voucher
   response - exception is if the MASA knows the Pledge doesn't pre-
   store the signing public key/cert , and thus needs to provide a cert
   or cert chain that links the signing identity/key to the pre-stored
   Trust Anchor that is inside the Pledge.

10.  Extensions to Discovery

   It is assumed that a Join Proxy as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-join-proxy] seamlessly provides a
   (relayed) DTLS connection between the Pledge and the Registrar.  To
   use a Join Proxy, a Pledge needs to discover it.  For Pledge
   discovery of a Join Proxy, this section extends Section 4.1 of
   [RFC8995] for the constrained BRSKI case.

   In general, the Pledge may be one or more hops away from the
   Registrar, where one hop means the Registrar is a direct link-local
   neighbor of the Pledge.  The case of one hop away can be considered
   as a degenerate case, because a Join Proxy is not really needed then.










Richardson, et al.        Expires 10 June 2023                 [Page 39]

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   The degenerate case would be unusual in constrained wireless network
   deployments, because a Registrar would typically not have a wireless
   network interface of the type used for constrained devices.  Rather,
   it would have a high-speed network interface.  Nevertheless, the
   situation where the Registrar is one hop away from the Pledge could
   occur in various cases like wired IoT networks or in wireless
   constrained networks where the Pledge is in radio range of a 6LoWPAN
   Border Router (6LBR) and the 6LBR happens to host a Registrar.

   In order to support the degenerate case, the Registrar SHOULD
   announce itself as if it were a Join Proxy -- though it would
   actually announce its real (stateful) Registrar CoAPS endpoint.  No
   actual Join Proxy functionality is then required on the Registrar.

   So, a Pledge only needs to discover a Join Proxy, regardless of
   whether it is one or more than one hop away from a relevant
   Registrar.  It first discovers the link-local address and the join-
   port of a Join Proxy.  The Pledge then follows the constrained BRSKI
   procedure of initiating a DTLS connection using the link-local
   address and join-port of the Join Proxy.

   Once enrolled, a Pledge itself may function as a Join Proxy.  The
   decision whether or not to provide this functionality depends upon
   many factors and is out of scope for this document.  Such a decision
   might depend upon the amount of energy available to the device, the
   network bandwidth available, as well CPU and memory availability.

   The process by which a Pledge discovers the Join Proxy, and how a
   Join Proxy discovers the location of the Registrar, are the subject
   of the remainder of this section.  Further details on both these
   topics are provided in [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-join-proxy].

10.1.  Discovery operations by Pledge

   The Pledge must discover the address/port and protocol with which to
   communicate.  The present document only defines coaps (CoAP over
   DTLS) as a protocol.

   Note that the identifying the format of the voucher-request and the
   voucher is not a required part of the Pledge's discovery operation.
   It is assumed that all Registrars support all relevant voucher(-
   request) formats, while the Pledge only supports a single format.  A
   Pledge that makes a voucher request to a Registrar that does not
   support that format will receive a CoAP 4.06 Not Acceptable status
   code and the bootstrap attempt will fail.

10.1.1.  GRASP discovery

   This section is normative for uses with an ANIMA ACP.  In the context
   of autonomic networks, the Join-Proxy uses the DULL GRASP M_FLOOD
   mechanism to announce itself.  Section 4.1.1 of [RFC8995] discusses
   this in more detail.

   The following changes are necessary with respect to figure 10 of
   [RFC8995]:

   *  The transport-proto is IPPROTO_UDP

   *  the objective is AN_Proxy

   The Registrar announces itself using ACP instance of GRASP using
   M_FLOOD messages.  Autonomic Network Join Proxies MUST support GRASP
   discovery of Registrar as described in section 4.3 of [RFC8995] .

   Here is an example M_FLOOD announcing the Join-Proxy at fe80::1, on
   standard coaps port 5684, using DTLS.

        [M_FLOOD, 12340815, h'fe800000000000000000000000000001', 180000,

        [O_IPv6_LOCATOR,
        h'fe800000000000000000000000000001', IPPROTO_UDP, 5684]]]

            Figure 4: Example of Join Proxy announcement message

   Note that a Join Proxy that supports also supports RFC8995 onboarding
   using HTTPS may announce more than one objective.  Objectives with an
   empty objective-value (whether CBOR NULL or an empty string) refer to
   [RFC8995] defaults.

   Here is an example of an announcement that offers both constrained
   and unconstrained onboarding:

        [M_FLOOD, 12340851, h'fe800000000000000000000000000001', 180000,

10.1.2.  CoAP Discovery

   Further details on CoAP discovery by a Pledge are provided in
   Section 5.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-join-proxy].

10.2.  Discovery operations by Join Proxy

   The Join Proxy needs to discover a Registrar, at the moment it needs
   to relay data towards the Registrar or prior to that moment.

10.2.1.  GRASP Discovery

   This section is normative for uses with an ANIMA ACP.  In the context
   of autonomic networks, the Registrar announces itself to a stateful
   Join Proxy using ACP instance of GRASP using M_FLOOD messages.
   Section 4.3 of [RFC8995] discusses this in more detail.

   The following changes are necessary with respect to figure 10 of
   [RFC8995]:

   *  The transport-proto is IPPROTO_UDP

   *  the objective is AN_join_registrar, identical to [RFC8995].

   *  the objective name is "BRSKI_JP".

   The Registrar announces itself using ACP instance of GRASP using
   M_FLOOD messages.  Autonomic Network Join Proxies MUST support GRASP
   discovery of Registrar as described in section 4.3 of [RFC8995].

   Here is an example M_FLOOD announcing the Registrar on example port
   5684, which is the standard CoAPS port number.

      [M_FLOOD, 51804321, h'fda379a6f6ee00000200000064000001', 180000,
      [["AN_join_registrar", 4, 255, "BRSKI_JP"],
       [O_IPv6_LOCATOR,
        h'fda379a6f6ee00000200000064000001', IPPROTO_UDP, 5684]]]

            Figure 6: Example of Registrar announcement message

   The Registrar uses a routable address that can be used by enrolled
   constrained Join Proxies.  The address will typically be a ULA (as it
   is in the example), but could also be a GUA.

10.2.2.  CoAP discovery

   Further details on CoAP discovery of the Registrar by a Join Proxy
   are provided in Section 5.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-join-proxy].

11.  Deployment-specific Discovery Considerations

   This section details how discovery is done in specific deployment
   scenarios.

11.1.  6TSCH Deployments

   In 6TISCH networks, the Constrained Join Proxy (CoJP) mechanism is
   described in [RFC9031].  Such networks are expected to use a
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] to do key management.  This is the subject of
   future work.  The Enhanced Beacon has been extended in [RFC9032] to
   allow for discovery of the Join Proxy.

11.2.  Generic networks using GRASP

   [RFC8995] defines a mechanism for the Pledge to discover a Join Proxy
   by listening for [RFC8990] GRASP messages.  This mechanism can be
   used on any network which does not have another more specific
   mechanism.  This mechanism supports mesh networks, and can also be
   used over unencrypted WIFI.

11.3.  Generic networks using mDNS

   [RFC8995] also defines a non-normative mechanism for the Pledge to
   discover a Join Proxy by doing mDNS queries.  This mechanism can be
   used on any network which does not have another recommended
   mechanism.  This mechanism does not easily support mesh networks.  It
   can be used over unencrypted WIFI.

11.4.  Thread networks using Mesh Link Establishment (MLE)

   Thread [Thread] is a wireless mesh network protocol based on 6LoWPAN
   [RFC6282] and other IETF protocols.  In Thread, a new device
   discovers potential Thread networks and Thread routers to join by
   using the Mesh Link Establishment (MLE)
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-mesh-link-establishment] protocol.  MLE uses the UDP
   port number 19788.  The new device sends discovery requests on
   different IEEE 802.15.4 radio channels, to which routers (if any
   present) respond with a discovery response containing information
   about their respective network.  Once a suitable router is selected
   the new device initiates a DTLS transport-layer secured connection to
   the network's commissioning application, over a link-local single



Richardson, et al.        Expires 10 June 2023                 [Page 43]

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   radio hop to the selected Thread router.  This link is not yet
   secured at the radio level: link-layer security will be set up once
   the new device is approved by the commissioning application to join
   the Thread network, and it gets provisioned with network access
   credentials.

   The Thread router acts here as a Join Proxy.  The MLE discovery
   response message contains UDP port information to signal the new
   device which port to use for its DTLS connection.

12.  Design Considerations

   The design considerations for the CBOR encoding of vouchers are much
   the same as for JSON vouchers in [RFC8366].  One key difference is
   that the names of the leaves in the YANG definition do not affect the
   size of the resulting CBOR, as the SID translation process assigns
   integers to the names.

   Any POST request to the Registrar with resource /vs or /es returns a
   2.04 Changed response with empty payload.  The client should be aware
   that the server may use a piggybacked CoAP response (ACK, 2.04) but
   may also respond with a separate CoAP response, i.e. first an (ACK,
   0.0) that is an acknowledgement of the request reception followed by
   a (CON, 2.04) response in a separate CoAP message.

13.  Raw Public Key Use Considerations

   This section explains techniques to reduce the number of bytes that
   are sent over the wire during the BRSKI bootstrap.  The use of a raw
   public key (RPK) in the pinning process can significantly reduce the
   number of bytes and round trips, but it comes with a few significant
   operational limitations.

13.1.  The Registrar Trust Anchor

   When the Pledge first connects to the Registrar, the connection to
   the Registrar is provisional, as explained in Section 5.6.2 of
   [RFC8995].  The Registrar provides its public key in a
   TLSServerCertificate, and the Pledge uses that to validate that
   integrity of the (D)TLS connection, but it does not validate the
   identity of the provided certificate.

   As the TLSServerCertificate object is never verified directly by the
   pledge, sending it can be considered superfluous.  Instead of using a
   (TLSServer)Certificate of type X509 (see section 4.4.2 of [RFC8446]),
   a RawPublicKey object is used.





Richardson, et al.        Expires 10 June 2023                 [Page 44]

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   A Registrar operating in a mixed environment can determine whether to
   send a Certificate or a Raw Public key: this is determined by the
   pledge including the server_certificate_type of RawPublicKey.  This
   is shown in section 5 of [RFC7250].

   The Pledge continues to send a client_certificate_type of X509, so
   that the Registrar can properly identify the pledge and distill the
   MASA URI information from its certificate.

13.2.  The Pledge Voucher Request

   The Pledge puts the Registrar's public key into the proximity-
   registrar-pubk field of the voucher-request.  (The proximity-
   registrar-pubk-sha256 can also be used if the 32-bytes of a SHA256
   hash turns out to be smaller than a typical ECDSA key.)

   As the format of the pubk field is identical to the TLS Certificate
   RawPublicKey, no manipulation at all is needed to insert this into a
   voucher-request.

13.3.  The Voucher Response

   A returned voucher will have a pinned-domain-subk field with the
   identical key as was found in the proximity-registrar-pubk field
   above, as well as in the TLS connection.

   Validation of this key by the pledge is what takes the DTLS
   connection out of the provisional state see Section 5.6.2 of
   [RFC8995].

   The voucher needs to be validated first.  The Pledge needs to have a
   public key to validate the signature from the MASA on the voucher.

   In certain cases, the MASA's public key counterpart of the (private)
   signing key is already installed in the Pledge at manufacturing time.
   In other cases, if the MASA signing key is based upon a PKI (see
   [I-D.richardson-anima-masa-considerations] Section 2.3), then a
   certificate chain may need to be included with the voucher in order
   for the pledge to validate the signature.  In CMS signed artifacts,
   the CMS structure has a place for such certificates.

   In the COSE-signed Constrained Vouchers described in this document,
   the x5bag attribute from [I-D.ietf-cose-x509] is used to contain the
   needed certificates and chain.

14.  Use of constrained vouchers with HTTPS

   This specification contains two extensions to [RFC8995]: a
   constrained voucher format (COSE), and a constrained transfer
   protocol (CoAP).

   On constrained networks with constrained devices, it make senses to
   use both together.  However, this document does not mandate that this
   be the only way.

   A given constrained device design and software may be re-used for
   multiple device models, such as a model having only an IEEE 802.15.4
   radio, or a model having only an IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) radio, or a
   model having both these radios.  A manufacturer of such device models
   may wish to have code only for the use of the constrained voucher
   format (COSE), and use it on all supported radios including the IEEE
   802.11 radio.  For this radio, the software stack to support HTTP/TLS
   may be already integrated into the radio module hence it is
   attractive for the manufacturer to reuse this.  This type of approach
   is supported by this document.  In the case that HTTPS is used, the
   normal [RFC8995] resource names are used, together with the media
   types described in this document.

   Other combinations are possible, but they are not enumerated here.
   New work such as [I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher] provides new formats
   that may be useable over a number of different transports.  In
   general, sending larger payloads over constrained networks makes less
   sense, while sending smaller payloads over unconstrained networks is
   perfectly acceptable.

   The Pledge will in most cases support a single voucher format, which
   it uses without negotiation i.e. without discovery of formats
   supported.  The Registrar, being unconstrained, is expected to
   support all voucher formats.  There will be cases where a Registrar
   does not support a new format that a new Pledge uses, and this is an
   unfortunate situation that will result in lack of interoperation.

   The responsability for supporting new formats is on the Registrar.

15.1.  Duplicate serial-numbers

   In the absense of correct use of idevid-issuer by the Registrar as
   detailed in Section 8.4, it would be possible for a malicious
   Registrar to use an unauthorized voucher for a device.  This would
   apply only to the case where a Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA) is trusted by different products from the same
   manufacturer, and the manufacturer has duplicated serial numbers as a
   result of a merge, acquisition or mis-management.

   For example, imagine the same manufacturer makes light bulbs as well
   as gas centrifuges, and said manufacturer does not uniquely allocate
   product serial numbers.  This attack only works for nonceless
   vouchers.  The attacker has obtained a light bulb which happens to
   have the same serial-number as a gas centrofuge which it wishes to
   obtain access.  The attacker performs a normal BRSKI onboarding for
   the light bulb, but then uses the resulting voucher to onboard the
   gas centrofuge.  The attack requires that the gas centrofuge be
   returned to a state where it is willing to perform a new onboarding
   operation.

   This attack is prevented by the mechanism of having the Registrar
   include the idevid-issuer in the RVR, and the MASA including it in
   the resulting voucher.  The idevid-issuer is not included by default:
   a MASA needs to be aware if there are parts of the organization which
   duplicates serial numbers, and if so, include it.

15.2.  IDevID security in Pledge

   The security of this protocol depends upon the Pledge identifying
   itself to the Registrar using it's manufacturer installed
   certificate: the IDevID certificate.  Associated with this
   certificate is the IDevID private key, known only to the Pledge.
   Disclosure of this private key to an attacker would permit the
   attacker to impersonate the Pledge towards the Registrar, probably
   gaining access credentials to that Registrar's network.

   If the IDevID private key disclosure is known to the manufacturer,
   there is little recourse other than recall of the relevant part
   numbers.  The process for communicating this recall would be within
   the BRSKI-MASA protocol.  Neither this specification nor [RFC8995]
   provides for consultation of a Certification Revocation List (CRL) or
   Open Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) by a Registrar when
   evaluating an IDevID certificate.  However, the BRSKI-MASA protocol
   submits the IDevID from the Registrar to the manufacturer's MASA and
   a manufacturer would have an opportunity to decline to issue a
   voucher for a device which they believe has become compromised.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   It may be difficult for a manufacturer to determine when an IDevID
   private key has been disclosed.  Two situations present themselves:
   in the first situation a compromised private key might be reused in a
   counterfeit device, which is sold to another customer.  This would
   present itself as an onboarding of the same device in two different
   networks.  The manufacturer may become suspicious seeing two voucher
   requests for the same device from different Registrars.  Such
   activity could be indistinguishable from a device which has been
   resold from one operator to another, or re-deployed by an operator
   from one location to another.

   In the second situation, an attacker having compromised the IDevID
   private key of a device might then install malware into the same
   device and attempt to return it to service.  The device, now blank,
   would go through a second onboarding process with the original
   Registrar.  Such a Registrar could notice that the device has been
   "factory reset" and alert the operator to this situation.  One remedy
   against the presence of malware is through the use of Remote
   Attestation such as described in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].
   Future work will need to specify a background-check Attestation flow
   as part of the voucher-request/voucher-response process.  Attestation
   may still require access to a private key (e.g.  IDevID private key)
   in order to sign Evidence, so a primary goal should be to keep any
   private key safe within the Pledge.

   In larger, more expensive, systems there is budget (power, space, and
   bill of materials) to include more specific defenses for a private
   key.  For instance, this includes putting the IDevID private key in a
   Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or use of Trusted Execution
   Environments (TEE) for access to the key.  On smaller IoT devices,
   the cost and power budget for an extra part is often prohibitive.

   It is becoming more and more common for CPUs to have an internal set
   of one-time fuses that can be programmed (often they are "burnt" by a
   laser) at the factory.  This section of memory is only accessible in
   some priviledged CPU state.  The use of this kind of CPU is
   appropriate as it provides significant resistance against key
   disclosure even when the device can be disassembled by an attacker.

   In a number of industry verticals, there is increasing concern about
   counterfeit parts.  These may be look-alike parts created in a
   different factory, or parts which are created in the same factory
   during an illegal night-shift, but which are not subject to the
   appropriate level of quality control.  The use of a manufacturer-
   signed IDevID certificate provides for discovery of the pedigree of
   each part, and this often justifies the cost of the security measures
   associated with storing the private key.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


15.3.  Security of CoAP and UDP protocols

   Section 7.1 explains that no CoAPS version of the BRSKI-MASA protocol
   is proposed.  The connection from the Registrar to the MASA continues
   to be HTTPS as in [RFC8995].  This has been done to simplify the MASA
   deployment for the manufacturer, because no new protocol needs to be
   enabled on the server.

   The use of UDP protocols across the open Internet is sometimes
   fraught with security challenges.  Denial-of-service attacks against
   UDP based protocols are trivial as there is no three-way handshake as
   done for TCP.  The three-way handshake of TCP guarantees that the
   node sending the connection request is reachable using the origin IP
   address.  While DTLS contains an option to do a stateless challenge
   -- a process actually stronger than that done by TCP -- it is not yet
   common for this mechanism to be available in hardware at multigigabit
   speeds.  It is for this reason that this document defines using HTTPS
   for the Registrar to MASA connection.

15.4.  Registrar Certificate may be self-signed

   The provisional (D)TLS connection formed by the Pledge with the
   Registrar does not authenticate the Registrar's identity.  This
   Registrar's identity is validated by the [RFC8366] voucher that is
   issued by the MASA, signed with an anchor that was built-in to the
   Pledge.

   The Registrar may therefore use any certificate, including a self-
   signed one.  The only restrictions on the certificate is that it MUST
   have EKU bits set as detailed in Section 7.3.1.

15.5.  Use of RPK alternatives to proximity-registrar-cert

   In Section 9.1 two compact alternative fields for proximity-
   registrar-cert are defined that include an RPK: proximity-registrar-
   pubk and proximity-registrar-pubk-sha256.  The Pledge can use these
   fields in its PVR to identify the Registrar based on its public key
   only.  Since the full certificate of the proximate Registrar is not
   included, use of these fields by a Pledge implies that a Registrar
   could insert another certificate with the same public key identity
   into the RVR.  For example, an older or a newer version of its
   certificate.  The MASA will not be able to detect such act by the
   Registrar.  But since any 'other' certificate the Registrar could
   insert in this way still encodes its identity the additional risk of
   using the RPK alternatives is neglible.

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


   When a Registrar sees a PVR that uses one of proximity-registrar-pubk
   or proximity-registrar-pubk-sha256 fields, this implies the Registrar
   must include the certificate identified by these fields into its RVR.
   Otherwise, the MASA is unable to verify proximity.  This requirement
   is already implied by the "MUST" requirement in Section 8.1.

15.6.  MASA support of CoAPS

   The use of CoAP for the BRSKI-MASA connection is not in scope of the
   current document.  The following security considerations have led to
   this choice of scope:

   *  the technology and experience to build secure Internet-scale HTTPS
      responders (which the MASA is) is common, while the experience in
      doing the same for CoAP is much less common.

   *  in many enterprise networks, outgoing UDP connections are often
      treated as suspicious, which could effectively block CoAP
      connections for some firewall configurations.

   *  reducing the complexity of MASA (i.e. less protocols supported)
      would also reduce its potential attack surface, which is relevant
      since the MASA is 24/7 exposed on the Internet and accepting
      (untrusted) incoming connections.

16.  IANA Considerations

16.1.  GRASP Discovery Registry

   IANA is asked to extend the registration of the "AN_Proxy" (without
   quotes) in the "GRASP Objective Names" table in the Grasp Parameter
   registry.  This document should also be cited for this existing
   registration, because Section 10.1.1 defines the new protocol value
   IPPROTO_UDP for the objective.

   IANA is asked to extend the registration of the "AN_join_registrar"
   (without quotes) in the "GRASP Objective Names" table in the Grasp
   Parameter registry.  This document should also be cited for this
   existing registration, because Section 10.2.1 adds the objective
   value "BRSKI_JP" to the objective.

16.2.  Resource Type Registry

   Additions to the sub-registry "Resource Type Link Target Attribute
   Values", within the "CoRE Parameters" IANA registry are specified
   below.

Appendix A.  Library Support for BRSKI

   For the implementation of BRSKI, the use of a software library to
   manipulate certificates and use crypto algorithms is often
   beneficial.  Two C-based examples are OpenSSL and mbedtls.  Others
   more targeted to specific platforms or languages exist.  It is
   important to realize that the library interfaces differ significantly
   between libraries.

   Libraries do not support all known crypto algorithms.  Before
   deciding on a library, it is important to look at their supported
   crypto algorithms and the roadmap for future support.  Apart from
   availability, the library footprint, and the required execution
   cycles should be investigated beforehand.

   The handling of certificates usually includes the checking of a
   certificate chain.  In some libraries, chains are constructed and
   verified on the basis of a set of certificates, the trust anchor
   (usually self signed root CA), and the target certificate.  In other
   libraries, the chain must be constructed beforehand and obey order
   criteria.  Verification always includes the checking of the
   signatures.  Less frequent is the checking the validity of the dates
   or checking the existence of a revoked certificate in the chain
   against a set of revoked certificates.  Checking the chain on the
   consistency of the certificate extensions which specify the use of
   the certificate usually needs to be programmed explicitly.

   A libary can be used to construct a (D)TLS connection.  It is useful
   to realize that differences beetween (D)TLS implementations will
   occur due to the differences in the certicate checks supported by the
   library.  On top of that, checks between client and server
   certificates enforced by (D)TLS are not always helpful for a BRSKI
   implementation.  For example, the certificates of Pledge and
   Registrar are usually not related when the BRSKI protocol is started.
   It must be verified that checks on the relation between client and
   server certificates do not hamper a succeful DTLS connection
   establishment.

Appendix B.  Constrained BRSKI-EST Message Examples

   This appendix extends the message examples from Appendix A of
   [RFC9148] with constrained BRSKI messages.  The CoAP headers are only
   fully worked out for the first example, enrollstatus.

B.1.  enrollstatus

   A coaps enrollstatus message from Pledge to Registrar can be as
   follows:

       POST coaps://192.0.2.1:8085/b/es
         Content-Format: 60
         Payload: <binary CBOR enrollstatus document>

   The corresponding CoAP header fields are shown below.

     Ver = 1
     T = 0 (CON)
     TKL = 1
     Code = 0x02 (0.02 is POST method)
     Message ID = 0xab0f
     Token = 0x4d
     Options
      Option  (Uri-Path)
        Option Delta = 0xb   (option nr = 11)
        Option Length = 0x1
        Option Value = "b"
      Option  (Uri-Path)
        Option Delta = 0x0   (option nr = 11)
        Option Length = 0x2
        Option Value = "es"
      Option  (Content-Format)
        Option Delta = 0x1   (option nr = 12)
        Option Length = 0x1
        Option Value = 60    (application/cbor)
     Payload Marker = 0xFF
     Payload = A26776657273696F6E0166737461747573F5 (18 bytes binary)

   The Uri-Host and Uri-Port Options are omitted because they coincide
   with the transport protocol (UDP) destination address and port
   respectively.

   The above binary CBOR enrollstatus payload looks as follows in CBOR
   diagnostic notation, for the case of enrollment success:

Internet-Draft              Constrained BRSKI              December 2022


     {
       "version": 1,
       "status": true
      }

   Alternatively the payload could look as follows in case of enrollment
   failure, using the reason field to describe the failure:

     Payload = A36776657273696F6E0166737461747573F466726561736F6E782A3C
               496E666F726D61746976652068756D616E207265616461626C652065
               72726F72206D6573736167653E

     {
       "version": 1,
       "status": false,
       "reason": "<Informative human readable error message>"
     }

   To indicate successful reception of the enrollmentstatus telemetry
   report, a response from the Registrar may then be:

      2.04 Changed

   With CoAP fields:

     Ver=1
     T=2 (ACK)
     TKL=1
     Code = 0x44 (2.04 Changed)
     Message ID = 0xab0f
     Token = 0x4d

B.2.  voucher_status

   A coaps voucher_status message from Pledge to Registrar can be as
   follows:

       POST coaps://[2001:db8::2:1]/.well-known/brski/vs
         Content-Format: 60 (application/cbor)
         Payload:
   a46776657273696f6e0166737461747573f466726561736f6e7828496e66
   6f726d61746976652068756d616e2d7265616461626c65206572726f7220
   6d6573736167656e726561736f6e2d636f6e74657874a100764164646974
   696f6e616c20696e666f726d6174696f6e

   The request payload above is binary CBOR but represented here in
   hexadecimal for readability.  Below is the equivalent CBOR diagnostic
   format.

     "status": false,
     "reason": "Informative human-readable error message",
     "reason-context": { 0: "Additional information" }
   }

   A success response without payload will then be sent by the Registrar
   back to the Pledge to indicate reception of the telemetry report:

      2.04 Changed

C.2.  Pledge, Registrar, Domain CA and MASA Certificates

   All keys and certificates used for the examples have been generated
   with OpenSSL - see Appendix D for more details on certificate
   generation.  Below the certificates are listed that accompany the
   keys shown above.  Each certificate description is followed by the
   hexadecimal representation of the X.509 ASN.1 DER encoded
   certificate.  This representation can be for example decoded using an
   online ASN.1 decoder.

C.3.  COSE-signed Pledge Voucher Request (PVR)

   In this example, the voucher request (PVR) has been signed by the
   Pledge using the IDevID private key of Appendix C.1.1, and has been
   sent to the link-local constrained Join Proxy (JP) over CoAPS to the
   JP's join port.  The join port happens to use the default CoAPS UDP
   port 5684.

     REQ: POST coaps://[JP-link-local-address]/b/rv
     Content-Format: 836
     Payload: <signed_pvr>

   When the Join Proxy receives the DTLS handshake messages from the
   Pledge, it will relay these messages to the Registrar.  The payload
   signed_voucher_request is shown as hexadecimal dump (with lf added)
   below:

   The Pledge uses the "proximity" (key '1', SID key 2502, enum value 2)
   assertion together with an included proximity-registrar-pubk field
   (key '12', SID 2513) to inform MASA about its proximity to the
   specific Registrar.

C.4.  COSE-signed Registrar Voucher Request (RVR)

   In this example the Registrar's voucher request has been signed by
   the JRC (Registrar) using the private key from Appendix C.1.2.
   Contained within this voucher request is the voucher request PVR that
   was made by the Pledge to JRC.  Note that the RVR uses the HTTPS
   protocol (not CoAP) and corresponding long URI path names as defined
   in [RFC8995].  The Content-Type and Accept headers indicate the
   constrained voucher format that is defined in the present document.
   Because the Pledge used this format in the PVR, the JRC must also use
   this format in the RVR.

   <CODE ENDS>

   The largest element in the voucher is identified by key 8, which
   decodes to SID key 2459 (pinned-domain-cert).  It contains the
   complete DER-encoded X.509 certificate of the Registrar's domain CA.
   This certificate is shown in Appendix C.2.3.

Appendix D.  Generating Certificates with OpenSSL

   This informative appendix shows an example of a Bash shell script to
   generate test certificates for the Pledge IDevID, the Registrar and
   the MASA.  This shell script cannot be run stand-alone because it
   depends on particular input files which are not included in this
   appendix.  Nevertheless, this example script may provide guidance on
   how OpenSSL can be configured for generating Constrained BRSKI
   certificates.

   Note: the *-comb.crt certificate files combine the certificate with
   the private key.  These are generated to be used by libcoap for DTLS
   connection establishment.

Appendix E.  Pledge Device Class Profiles

   This specification allows implementers to select between various
   functional options for the Pledge, yielding different code size
   footprints and different requirements on Pledge hardware.  Thus for
   each product an optimal trade-off between functionality, development/
   maintenance cost and hardware cost can be made.

   This appendix illustrates different selection outcomes by means of
   defining different example "profiles" of constrained Pledges.  In the
   following subsections, these profiles are defined and a comparison is
   provided.

E.1.  Minimal Pledge

   The Minimal Pledge profile (Min) aims to reduce code size and
   hardware cost to a minimum.  This comes with some severe functional
   restrictions, in particular:

   *  No support for EST re-enrollment: whenever this would be needed, a
      factory reset followed by a new bootstrap process is required.

   *  No support for change of Registrar: for this case, a factory reset
      followed by a new bootstrap process is required.

   This profile would be appropriate for single-use devices which must
   be replaced rather than re-deployed.  That might include medical
   devices, but also sensors used during construction, such as concrete
   temperature sensors.

E.2.  Typical Pledge

   The Typical Pledge profile (Typ) aims to support a typical
   Constrained BRSKI feature set including EST re-enrollment support and
   Registrar changes.

E.3.  Full-featured Pledge

   The Full-featured Pledge profile (Full) illustrates a Pledge category
   that supports multiple bootstrap methods, hardware real-time clock,
   BRSKI/EST resource discovery, and CSR Attributes request/response.
   It also supports most of the optional features defined in this
   specification.

E.4.  Comparison Chart of Pledge Classes

   The below table specifies the functions implemented in the three
   example Pledge classes Min, Typ and Full.
